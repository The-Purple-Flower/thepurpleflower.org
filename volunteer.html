              <dt>How can I get involved as a volunteer?</dt>
              <dd>Join us on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Point</a> app where you can sign up to volunteer with us, and explore other volunteer opportunities in Carroll County. Once you've created an account, be sure to "Join" The Purple Flower to join our interested list. Due to the nature of our services, some volunteer opportunities require additional orientation and vetting. Whatever level of involvement you're interested in, once you join our list, you'll be the first to hear as soon as we have volunteer opportunties that match your preferences and availability.</dd>

              <dt>I signed up on a Volunteer List while at an event. When can I expect to hear back from you?</dt>
              <dd>Thank you for taking the time to give us your contact information.
              We've been manually entering contact information from paper lists into our new 
            Volunteer Management system and plan to have notified everyone by August 15th.
            <br><brr>    
          If you still haven't heard from us, it could be due to a typo or your invitation getting lost in spam. Please accept our sincerest apology and register directly on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Point</a>, our new Volunteer Management system.

          You can also join our general mailing list here to receive ocassional updates from us, including updates on our new volunteer program and other initiatives as they develop.

        </dd>

              <dd>Join us on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Point</a> app where you can sign up to volunteer with us, and explore other volunteer opportunities in Carroll County. 
              Once you've signed up, you'll be on our list and will be the first to hear as soon as we have volunteer opportunities based on your preferences and availability.</dd>

              <dt>What kind of supplies do your clients need? I'm cleaning house and would love to donate items.</dt>
              <dd>Since we don't have a shelter in Carrol County, most of our crisis care involves helping clients find temporary housing and prepared meals. Our office has limited space, so unfortunately we only accept bulky items on designated drive days (see our volunteer system, <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Point</a>, for such events). 
                <ul>
                  <li>Condiment Packets: sealed & clean</li>
                  <li>Travel Size Bath & Body Products: shampoo, conditioner, tooth paste, mouth wash, face wipes, make-up remover</li>
                  <li>Toothbrushes: new, in packaging</li>
                  <li>Hair brushes & combs: clean</li>
                </ul>
              </dd>

              <dt>Where and when can I drop off supplies?</dt>
              <dd>You can drop off supplies anytime during regular business hours: M-F 10am-3pm at our office in Berryville (see below for address and directions).</dd>

              <dt>I'm a Service Professional that would like to provide counseling, legal, therapeutic, or other licensed care to your clients. Who should I reach out to?</dt>
              <dd>Thank you! Clients in various stages of crisis and stabilization require support. We offer referrals where and when we can, though
              can not force a client into any care. 
                Please contact _____ to join our circle of providers. We are very busy, so please note that it can take some time for a response. Feel free to follow up if you haven't heard back from us within 2 weeks.</dd>

              <dt>I have another question not answered by these FAQs. What's the best way to ask?</dt>
              <dd>You're welcome to email us at _____@thepurpleflower.org â€” we appreciate you helping to keep our phone line open for potential crisis callers.</dd>


              <dt>Do You Have an Amazon Wish List?</dt>
              <dd>We do! You can purchase essential items directly for clients and our operations from our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/F1BDAPQ14RSS?ref_=wl_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Wishlist</a>.</dd>

        </div>
        <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    
            <p>We've joined several non-profits in Carroll County in launching our Volunteer Program on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Point</a> app &mdash; which gives community members an easy way to access all volunteer opportunities in our area.</p>

            <p>Due to our limited staffing and the high demand for our services, we haven't historically been able to keep up with the interest of volunteers. We appreciate that not everyone interested in helping out may want to join another app, and we also appreciate your understanding and willingness to try something new.</p>

          <h3>Creating Your Account</h3>
             <p>To get started, go to <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113">The Purple Flower on The Point</a>and click "Join Us" (see screenshot). This will prompt you to create an account (if you don't yet have one) and will then add you to our organization. You may not see any immediate events, but we will be notified and as we coordinate new batches of orientations and opportunities to get involved, you will hear from us. </p>

             <image src="assets/screenshot-thepoint-join.png" width="400"><br>

             <p>Getting started at this level will give you access to joining us for tabling events, fundraising efforts, and other
             activities that don't require advanced training or screening.</p>

          <h3>Specialty Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
             <p>We could use help with 1-on-1 specialty services like Translation, Emergency Transport, Legal Services, Client Advocacy, and administrative tasks requring training. If you'd like to be considered for such specialty volunteer services, please

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclDGT8g6PD1B2seiPxcZY3E9vD-IIT-oIhxPlT8DI2bUVBig/viewform?usp=header">submit this interest form</a> and as opportunities and trainings arise, we'll be in touch. </p>
