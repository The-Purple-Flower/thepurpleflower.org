              <dt>How can I get involved as a volunteer?</dt>
              <dd><!-- We're in the process of ramping up a new volunteer coordinator and are excited to have joined
                several other area non-profits in getting setup on a new platform for making
                onboarding and coordinating with volunteers much easier.
                <br><br> -->
                Due to the nature of our services, some volunteer opportunities require additional screening and onboarding. 
                Whatever level of involvement you're interested in, once you <a href="#volunteer">begin the application process</a>,
                you'll be the first to hear as soon as we have volunteer opportunties that match your preferences and availability.
              </dd>

              <dt>I signed up on a Volunteer List while at an event. When can I expect to hear back from you?</dt>
              <dd>Thank you for taking the time to give us your contact information.
              We've been manually entering contact information from paper lists into our new Volunteer Management system.
            If you still haven't heard from us by mid September 2025, it could be due to a typo or your invitation getting lost in spam. Please accept our sincerest apology and register directly on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113" target="_blank">The Point</a>, our new Volunteer Management system.
              <br><br>
              By registering, you can also join our mailing list to receive updates on other initiatives, along with volunteer
              opportunties, as they develop.
        </dd>

              <dd>Join us on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113" target="_blank">The Point</a> app where you can sign up to volunteer with us, and explore other volunteer opportunities in Carroll County. 
              Once you've signed up, you'll be on our list and will be the first to hear as soon as we have volunteer opportunities based on your preferences and availability.</dd>

              <dt>Do you accept donations of clothes, household items or old phones? What do your clients need?</dt>
              <dd>
                Our office has limited space, so please take clothes and household items to local thrift stores (ex: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cJjGdAzZ8QQBp3BQ6" target="_blank">St. Vincent dePaul in Berryville</a> or <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/z9CsELttgGqiu4nv6" target="_blank">ECHO Thrift in Eureka Springs</a>) where our clients are able to get what they need for free. 
                <br><br>
                The most useful in-kind donations are cell phones and new bulk supplies for “go bags” we provide to clients staying in temporary emergency safe lodging. Accepted items may be dropped off at <a href="./directions.html">our office during regular business hours</a>:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Used, unlocked phones</b>&mdash;to donate a phone, it must not be tied to a specific cell service provider (Verizon, AT&T, etc.). Please contact your provider for instructions on how to unlock your phone before bringing it in.</li>
                  <li><b>Personal Hygiene Products</b>&mdash;toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, combs, brushes, socks, underwear, travel-size shampoo, tampons and pads, etc.</li>
                  <li><b>Shelf-stable food</b> that doesn’t require refrigeration and can be heated up in a <em>microwave</em>.
                  <li><b>Condiment packets and utensils</b>&mdash;sealed & clean</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can also buy direct from our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/F1BDAPQ14RSS?ref_=wl_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="Amazon Wishlist" class="ga-track">Amazon Wish List</a>!</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Where and when can I drop off supplies?</dt>
              <dd>You can drop off supplies anytime during <a href="./directions.html">regular business hours at our office in Berryville</a>.</dd>

              <dt>I'm a Service Professional that would like to provide translation services, counseling, legal, therapeutic, or other licensed care to your clients. Who should I reach out to?</dt>
              <dd>
Thank you! Clients in various stages of crisis and stabilization often need support from professionals like you. 
We offer referrals where and when we can, but many cannot afford to pay for professional support. 
<br><br>
If you would like to be added to our referrals list, especially if you are willing to donate your services pro bono or at a reduced rate, please email <b>info&#x40;thepurpleflower.org</b> with your contact information and a link to the services you provide.
              </dd>

              <dt>I have another question not answered by these FAQs. What's the best way to ask?</dt>
              <dd>Email us at <b>info&#x40;thepurpleflower.org</b>. We appreciate you helping to keep our phone line open for potential crisis callers.</dd>

              <dt>Do You Have an Amazon Wish List?</dt>
              <dd>We do! You can purchase essential items directly for clients and our operations from our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/F1BDAPQ14RSS?ref_=wl_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Wishlist</a>.</dd>

            Join us on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113" target="_blank">The Point</a> app where you can sign up to volunteer with us, and explore other volunteer opportunities in Carroll County. Once you've created an account, be sure to "Join" The Purple Flower to join our interested list. Due to the nature of our services, some volunteer opportunities require additional orientation and vetting. Whatever level of involvement you're interested in, once you join our list, you'll be the first to hear as soon as we have volunteer opportunties that match your preferences and availability.
          -->


            <p>We've joined several non-profits in Carroll County in launching our Volunteer Program on <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113" target="_blank">The Point</a> app &mdash; which gives community members an easy way to access all volunteer opportunities in our area.</p>

            <p>Due to our limited staffing and the high demand for our services, we haven't historically been able to keep up with the interest of volunteers. We appreciate that not everyone interested in helping out may want to join another app, and we also appreciate your understanding and willingness to try something new.</p>

          <h3>Creating Your Account</h3>
             <p>To get started, go to <a href="https://pointapp.org/orgs/7113" target="_blank">The Purple Flower on The Point</a> and click "Join Us" (see screenshot). This will prompt you to create an account (if you don't yet have one) and will then add you to our organization. You may not see any immediate events, but rest assured that we will be notified of your interest.</p>

             <image src="assets/screenshot-thepoint-join.png" width="400"><br>

             <p>As we coordinate new batches of orientations and opportunities to get involved, you will hear from us. </p>

             <p>Getting started at this level will give you access to joining us for tabling events, fundraising efforts, and other
             activities that don't require advanced training or screening.</p>

          <h3>Specialty Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
             <p>We could use help with 1-on-1 specialty services like Translation, Emergency Transport, Legal Services, Client Advocacy, and administrative tasks requring training. If you'd like to be considered for such specialty volunteer services, please

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclDGT8g6PD1B2seiPxcZY3E9vD-IIT-oIhxPlT8DI2bUVBig/viewform?usp=header"  target="_blank">submit this interest form</a> and as opportunities and trainings arise, we'll be in touch. </p>
